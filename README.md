# Never Eat Alone
   An Android app that lets users find an eating companion in downtown Seattle.

## Problem Statement #1

There are times when people would like to eat out but do not want to eat alone. They might not be able to find anyone to eat with, or they simply do not want to ask others who probably might not want to eat out. There are also people who want to expand their network by eating with someone they have never met. The app would solve this problem of finding an eating companion at a restuarant of the user's choice.

## MVP Feature Set

1.  A feature to select a restuarant
    - This feature would allow the user to select a restuarant to show their interest in the restuarant at a certain date and time.
1.  A feature to show other interested people
    - The user can see who are interested in eating at the restuarant at a certain date and time.
1.  A feature to show availability
    - This feature would allow the users to set which restuarant and time they're available at.
1.  Invite feature
    - User can invite another user for a meal at a certain restuarant at a certain time. It will show notifications.

### Potential Additional Features

1. Messaging
    - User can chat with each other.
1. Rating
    - User can rate other users they have eaten with
1. User profile
    - Name and places the user has eaten at, her / his favorite foods and restuarants.
